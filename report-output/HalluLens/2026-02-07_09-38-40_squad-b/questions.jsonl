On the south side of the station is Winsor Avenue and Huntingdale Road is to the west. The station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency, and is operated by Metro Trains Melbourne. The station is approximately 17 kilometres (11 mi) or around a 28-minute train ride away from Flinders Street.\n\nJordanville station consists of an island platform which is connected to Winsor Avenue and Huntingdale Road via a pedestrian subway. The length of the platform is approximately 160 metres (520 ft), long enough for a Metro Trains 7-car HCMT. There is a single station which primarily functions as a waiting room.\n\nThe main car park at the station is located on Winsor Avenue just south of the station. In addition to the car park there is a bicycle shed with storage for 26 bikes. Although there are ramps they do not fully comply with the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992 as the gradient of the ramps is steeper than the maximum of 1:14 allowed under the Act.\n\n ### Services\n\nThe station is currently served by the Glen Waverley line which is operated by Metro Trains Melbourne. Services to Glen Waverley travel east. Services to the city head to Burnley, joining the Belgrave, Lilydale, and Alamein lines before heading to Richmond and traveling through the City Loop in a clockwise direction.\n\nPlatform 1:\n\n- all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street\n\nPlatform 2:\n\n- all stations services to Glen Waverley\n\n #### Transport Links\n\nJordanville is served by bus route 767 which departs the station from the bus stop on Huntingdale Road.\n\n- : Westfield Southland – Box Hill station\n\n", "prompt": "### Question\n\nWhat is the primary function of the pedestrian subway at Jordanville railway station?\n\n\n### Choices:\n\nA.

It is located in the English Channel, north-west of France and south of England. It is 2,183 m (7,162 ft) long and under 873 metres (2,864 ft) wide; oriented north–south, with several stretches of sand along its northern coast. The much larger island of Guernsey lies to the west, Jersey lies to the south-east, and the smaller island of Jethou is just off the south-west coast.\n\nHerm was first discovered in the Mesolithic period, and the first settlers arrived in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Many tombs from that period remain today, the majority in the north of the island. The island was annexed to the Duchy of Normandy in 933, but was transferred to the English Crown with the division of Normandy in 1204. It was occupied by Germany in the Second World War and the scene of Operation Huckaback, but was largely bypassed. Herm is currently managed by Herm Island Ltd, formed by Starboard Settlement, who acquired Herm in 2008, following fears during the sale of the island that the 'identity' of the island was at threat.\n\nHerm's harbour is on its west coast. There are several buildings of note in the vicinity including the White House, St Tugual's Chapel, Fisherman's Cottage, \"The Mermaid\" pub and restaurant, and a small primary school with about eight children. During a busy summer season up to 100,000 tourists visit the island, arriving by one of the catamaran ferries operated by the Trident Charter Company. Cars are banned from the island, as are bicycles; quad bikes and tractors used for staff and luggage transport respectively are allowed.\n\n ## History\n\n ### Prehistory\n\nHerm was first found in the Mesolithic period (between 10,000 and 8,000 BC), when hunters were in search of food. In the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, settlers arrived; the remains of chamber tombs have been found on the island, and may be seen today; specifically on the Common, and the Petit and Grand Monceau; it has been suggested that the northern end of the island, i.e. the Common, was set apart for burials. After a three-year project by the University of Durham, supported by specialists from the University of Cambridge, the University of Oxford, and the Guernsey museum, they stated that the \"density of tombs suggests that the northern end of Herm may have been a place set apart for funerary activity\".\n\n", "prompt": "### Question:\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct based on the reference material about Herm?\n\n\n### Choices:\nA.

Enemies vary in armor and weaponry—some cannot return fire but travel in waves to ram the player. The player's ship can use five types of weapons, with three levels of power each. Players boost weapon power by collecting powerups that match the current weapon's power; collecting a different color gives the player the first level of that weapon type.

These areas are often heavily shielded and must be hit repeatedly to remove armor. Other bosses' vulnerabilities are hidden and appear for only short periods. Most bosses have weapons that fire upon the player or reflect the player's shots.
