In a retrospective assessment, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, a writer for AllMusic, stated he felt that \"Leave Me Alone\" was the best track on Bad, commenting \"why are all of his best songs paranoid anthems?\" Steve Morse, a writer for The Boston Globe, described \"Leave Me Alone\" as a \"send-up\" of Jackson's feuds with the \"paparazzi-filled tabloids.\" Jon Pareles, of The New York Times, commented that \"Leave Me Alone\" had an \"unmistakable message\". After Jackson's death in June 2009, Rolling Stone listed \"Leave Me Alone\" as being one of Jackson's most monumental work, and the song's composition was generally praised.\n\n\"Leave Me Alone\" performed well on various charts. It was released as a single outside the United States and Canada. The song, similar to Bad's previous singles, proved to be a commercial success internationally. \"Leave Me Alone\"'s most successful territory was Ireland, where the song peaked at No. 1. The song saw similar chart success on the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Norwegian and Switzerland charts, peaking within the top 10 at Nos. 2, 5, 6 and 10, respectively. \"Leave Me Alone\" also peaked within the top 20 in Austria, France and Sweden, peaking at Nos. 15, 17 and 19, respectively.

The squadron was assigned to Admiral Beatty's Battlecruiser Fleet which had put to sea to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. The British were able to decode the German radio messages and left their bases before the Germans put to sea. Admiral Franz von Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 15:20, but Beatty's ships did not spot the Germans to their east until 15:30. Two minutes later, he ordered a course change to east south-east to position himself astride the German's line of retreat and called his ships' crews to action stations. He also ordered the 2nd BCS, which had been leading, to fall in astern of the 1st BCS. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard, away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and to reduce speed to 18 knots (33 km/h; 21 mph) to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, then about 60 nautical miles (110 km; 69 mi) behind him. Around this time Beatty altered course to the east as it was quickly apparent that he was still too far north to cut off Hipper. This began what was to be called the \"Run to the South\" as Beatty changed course to steer east south-east at 15:45, paralleling Hipper's course, now that the range closed to under 18,000 yards (16,000 m). The Germans opened fire first at 15:48, followed by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships, Lion and Princess Royal, had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The British formation was echeloned to the right with Indefatigable in the rear and furthest to the west, and New Zealand ahead of her and slightly further east.

His father, John Slack, farmed and made pottery; his mother's name was Mary J. Caldwell Slack. The family moved to Columbia in the Missouri Territory to pursue agricultural opportunities there, in 1819. Slack's father became a justice of the peace and grew tobacco. The younger Slack was educated in the Columbia area, studying law under one J. B. Gordon, but returned to Kentucky in 1837 to pursue a legal career. After returning to Columbia in 1839, he was admitted to the bar and relocated to Chillicothe where he opened a law office, as there were more opportunities for new lawyers in that town. According to historian Jeffery S. Prushankin, Slack gained a reputation for \"coolness under pressure as well as for his honesty and integrity\". Entering into politics in 1842 as a member of the Democratic Party, he was elected to the Missouri General Assembly. His term ended in 1843. Three years later he was part of Missouri's state constitutional convention. Slack married Mary E. Woodward in 1842 and they had two children during the 1840s.\n\nDespite opposing war in general, Slack organized a company in 1846 for service in the Mexican-American War. The unit became part of the 2nd Missouri Mounted Volunteers, and Slack was voted captain of Company L. The 2nd Missouri Volunteers served under Sterling Price during the war, and Slack was in the army for fourteen months. Engaged in the fighting that took place in the Santa Fe area, Slack's conduct at the Battle of Embudo Pass in January 1847 gained praise from Price, and Slack's men blocked the enemy's retreat route in the Siege of Pueblo de Taos.\n\nAfter his military service ended, Slack returned to Chillicothe and legal practice. Continuing to be involved in politics, he was influential in his local area. Supporting slavery and states' rights, he adhered to strict constructionism and opposed secession during the 1850s. Slack's wife died in 1858; he wed Isabella R. Bower the next year and they had two more children. During the 1860 United States presidential election, he supported the candidacy of John C. Breckinridge. After Abraham Lincoln won the election in 1860, Slack considered that secession and war were likely.\n\n ## Civil War service\n\n", "prompt": "### Question:\nWhat aspect of William Y.

Additionally, the software necessary to guide the LM to a landing was not available at the time of Apollo 10.\n\nCraig Nelson wrote in his book Rocket Men that NASA took special precaution to ensure Stafford and Cernan would not attempt to make the first landing. Nelson quoted Cernan as saying \"A lot of people thought about the kind of people we were: 'Don't give those guys an opportunity to land, 'cause they might!' So the ascent module, the part we lifted off the lunar surface with, was short-fueled. The fuel tanks weren't full.

They might have wanted to, but it was impossible for that lunar module to land.

The game was originally released in Japan on December 1, 1995, and later in North American and PAL regions in 1996. It is the third game in the Mega Man X series and the last to appear on the SNES. Mega Man X3 takes place in a fictional future in which the world is populated by humans and intelligent robots called \"Reploids\". Like their human creators, some Reploids involve themselves in destructive crime and are labelled as \"Mavericks\". After twice defeating the Maverick leader Sigma, the heroes X and Zero must battle a Reploid scientist named Dr. Doppler and his utopia of Maverick followers.\n\nMega Man X3 follows the tradition of both the original Mega Man series and the Mega Man X series as a standard action-platform game. The player traverses a series of eight stages in any order while gaining various power-ups and taking the special weapon of each stage's end boss. Mega Man X3 is the first game in the series in which Zero is a playable character (albeit in limited form) in addition to X. Like its predecessor, Mega Man X2, X3 features the \"Cx4\" chip to allow for some limited 3D vector graphics and transparency effects.\n\nA 32-bit version of Mega Man X3 was released on the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and Windows in various countries. This version was included in the North American Mega Man X Collection in 2006. A 3DO Interactive Multiplayer version was planned, but was canceled due to the failure of the console. The game was also ported to Japanese mobile phones in 2010. Critical reception for Mega Man X3 has been positive for its new inclusion of upgrades for X's abilities as well as the debut of Zero as a playable character. However, the game, particularly the 32-bit version, has received miscellaneous criticism from reviewers for its lack of improvements to the series. The SNES version of Mega Man X3 was released on the Wii U Virtual Console during 2014. The SNES version was re-released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One as part of Mega Man X Legacy Collection which released worldwide in 2018.\n\n", "prompt": "Question:\nWhat is the common alias for Mega Man X3 in Japan?\n\n### Choices:\nA.
