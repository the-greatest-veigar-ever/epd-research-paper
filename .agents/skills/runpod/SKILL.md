  Start here for any Runpod task — running GPU/CPU pods, deploying serverless
  endpoints, templates, network volumes, building images, or understanding how
  Runpod works. Routes to the right skill (runpod-mcp, runpodctl, flash,
  companion-clis, runpod-usage, runpod-migrate) and indexes two dozen live-verified
  end-to-end examples (golden paths) — use it when the lane is unclear, and for any
  multi-step or provisioning task even when it is not.

# Runpod (router)

The entrypoint for the Runpod skills. This skill does no work itself — it picks
the right lane and hands off. For a multi-step or provisioning task, check the
[worked examples](#worked-examples-golden-paths) first and let the matching one pick
the lane; otherwise read the matching skill's `SKILL.md` next.

## The lanes

| Lane | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| **runpod-mcp** | Manage infra (pods, endpoints, jobs, templates, volumes, registries, catalog, billing) via **structured tool calls** — when the Runpod MCP tools are connected in this session. |
| **runpodctl** | Manage the same infra from a **terminal/CI/script**, plus the things only the CLI does: Hub browse/deploy, `send`/`receive` file transfer, SSH keys, `doctor` setup, model cache. |
| **flash** | **Write Python** that runs on Runpod serverless — `@remote`/`@Endpoint` functions, `flash dev` hot-reload, `flash deploy`. Code-first, not infra management. |
| **companion-clis** | **Prerequisite artifacts**: download a model (`hf`), build/push an image (`docker`), repos/releases (`gh`), move data to a network volume over S3 (`aws`). |
| **runpod-usage** | **Understand** how Runpod works before acting — pods vs serverless, building a container, storage, GPU selection, gotchas. Knowledge only. |
| **runpod-migrate** | **Move existing code** off the GraphQL API or REST v1 onto REST v2 — inventory which parts use which version, rewrite call sites, flag breaking changes. Edits the user's code; does not manage infra. |

## These skills are a snapshot; the tools are the source of truth

Every lane below wraps something that ships on its own release train and moves faster than
this repo. So route with these skills, but **take capability and syntax from the tool in front
of you**:

| Lane | Ask it directly |
| --- | --- |
| runpodctl | `runpodctl --help`, `runpodctl <resource> <action> --help`, `runpodctl version`. For failure shapes, run a command wrong on purpose and read the JSON |
| runpod-mcp | your client's tool list (`/mcp` in Claude Code) — each tool carries its own parameter descriptions |
| flash | `flash --help`, and the deploy/dev output |
| companion-clis | that CLI's own `--help` (`hf`, `gh`, `docker`, `aws`) |
| REST v2 | the live spec at `https://api.runpod.io/v2/openapi.json` |

**Never tell a user a tool cannot do something without checking first.** A missing capability
is the claim most likely to be out of date here, and it is the one a reader has no reason to
reverify — it has already gone stale twice (runpodctl v2.9.0 added `serverless health`, v2.10.0
added `pod logs`/`serverless logs`). If a limit still holds, name the version it holds for
rather than saying "cannot".

## First run — check auth before the first infra action

Infra tasks (pods, endpoints, jobs, volumes) need a working control plane — the **Runpod MCP**
or **runpodctl**. Don't start and discover mid-task that nothing's set up: check first, and if
it isn't, help the user set up rather than limping on a partial fallback.

**Check** (credential resolution order: `RUNPOD_API_KEY` env → `.env` → `~/.runpod/config.toml`):
```bash
runpodctl user            # succeeds ⇒ a key is set and valid
```
Plus, in Claude Code, `/mcp` should show `runpod` **Connected**.

**Rule: get a key first — do not default to MCP OAuth.** The reason: one `RUNPOD_API_KEY`
unlocks every tool — it authenticates **runpodctl + flash + the hosted MCP** (as `--header
"Authorization: Bearer $RUNPOD_API_KEY"`). The MCP's "Sign in with Runpod" OAuth auths the **MCP alone** — the CLIs
stay blocked, so you hit a wall on any CLI-only task (Hub, `send`/`receive`, SSH, `doctor`,
model cache/Model Repository, CPU endpoints). ⚠️ **OAuth-only is a half-setup.** If nothing's
set up, stop and get a key, in order:
1. **`flash login`** — browser OAuth that saves a real key to `~/.runpod/config.toml` (runpodctl
   + flash read it; reuse it for the MCP Bearer). One step, unlocks all. Human-only.
2. **`export RUNPOD_API_KEY=…`** (https://console.runpod.io/user/settings) — same full unlock;
   best for headless agents.
3. **MCP OAuth only** (`/mcp` → *Sign in*) — last resort, MCP-only work; CLIs stay unauthed.

**Then:** if a lane already works, use it — but if *only* the MCP is OAuth'd, still get a key
before any CLI-only step. Missing a CLI? `curl -sSL https://cli.runpod.net | bash` (runpodctl) ·
`uv tool install runpod-flash` (flash) · `npx @runpod/mcp-server@latest add` (MCP). Full setup:
[`runpod-usage/reference/getting-started.md`](../runpod-usage/reference/getting-started.md).

## How to route

**0. Does a worked example already cover this?** For anything beyond a single call,
check [the golden-paths index](#worked-examples-golden-paths) *before* picking a lane —
a matching path already names the lane(s), the flags, the ordering, and the traps, so
routing becomes reading rather than re-deriving. Check it when **any** of these is true:

- the task needs **more than one resource** (image + template + endpoint, pod + volume,
  multi-region, …) or **more than one lane**
- it **provisions something billable**, or the user's ask is shaped like *"get X running /
  deployed / working"*
- it involves **storage, networking, autoscaling, streaming, or debugging a live resource** —
  the areas where the non-obvious ordering is the whole difficulty
- you are about to write a **multi-step plan** for it

Skip step 0 for a single read or a single CRUD call ("list my pods", "stop pod X",
"what GPUs are available") — go straight to the lane. **A matching golden path outranks
this router's lane table**: it was verified end to end on a real account, so where the two
disagree, follow the path and treat the difference as a bug worth reporting.

1. **Conceptual question, or an unmade design choice** (serverless vs pod? which
   GPU? bake the model or mount a volume?) → read **runpod-usage** first, then
   continue with the answer.
2. **Write/iterate/ship your own code on Runpod GPUs** → **flash**.
3. **Produce an artifact** (download a model, build+push an image, create a repo
   release, sync data to a volume) → **companion-clis**.
4. **Migrate existing code between Runpod API versions** — "move us to REST v2",
   "which Runpod API is this repo on?", "what breaks if we upgrade?" →
   **runpod-migrate**. (Calling the API to *do* something is a different job; that
   is the infra lanes below.)
5. **Manage infrastructure** (create/list/update/delete pods, endpoints,
   templates, volumes; list GPUs/data centers; run a serverless job; billing):
   - Capability only the CLI has — **Hub, `send`/`receive`, SSH keys, `doctor`,
     model cache** → **runpodctl**.
   - Otherwise, if the Runpod **MCP tools are connected** in this session
     (`create-pod`, `list-endpoints`, … are available) → **runpod-mcp**.
   - Otherwise (shell-only agent, no MCP) → **runpodctl**.

### runpod-mcp vs runpodctl (the overlap)

Both drive the same Runpod API, so they overlap on infra CRUD. Choose by
**capability first, environment second**:

- **MCP wins on convenience** for simple, structured operations — reads and basic
  CRUD — when its tools are connected (typed params, no shell quoting).
- **runpodctl takes over when an operation needs a capability MCP lacks** — even
  if MCP is connected — and is the only option for a shell-only agent or when the
  user wants a reproducible command.

Capability matrix (pick the preferred lane per operation):

| Operation | Preferred lane | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List/get anything; start/stop/restart/delete a pod; simple CRUD on endpoints, templates, volumes, registries; catalog; billing | **runpod-mcp** if connected, else runpodctl | Simple structured ops — MCP is typed and convenient |
| Create a **simple** pod (one image + one GPU) | **runpod-mcp** if connected, else runpodctl | Both handle it |
| Create a pod **from a template** or a **CPU** pod | **runpod-mcp** if connected, else runpodctl | MCP's create-pod takes `templateId` (v2-only) and `computeType: "CPU"` |
| Create a pod with a **multi-GPU priority list**, or **template + CPU together** | **runpodctl** | MCP narrows to one GPU type, and rejects a template deploy for a CPU pod |
| Deploy from the **Hub** | **runpod-mcp** if connected, else runpodctl | MCP has `list-hub-repos` + `deploy-hub-repo` |
| **File transfer** (`send`/`receive`), **SSH** keys/info, **`doctor`** setup, **model** cache | **runpodctl** | MCP has no tool for these |
| Invoke a serverless job (`run`/`runsync`/status/stream) | **runpod-mcp** if connected, else runpodctl | Both lanes have first-class job commands now (runpodctl `serverless run`/`status`/`health`, v2.9.0+); MCP is typed, and only MCP streams a job's incremental output (`stream-job`) |
| Read **pod or worker logs** | **either** — runpod-mcp if connected, else runpodctl | Both lanes read them: MCP `stream-pod-logs`/`stream-worker-logs` return parsed frames; runpodctl `pod logs`/`serverless logs` emit json lines and `--follow` (v2.10.0+) |

Rule of thumb: **default to MCP for the easy stuff, hand off to runpodctl the
moment an op needs a flag/feature MCP doesn't expose.**

## Deploying a workload (the golden loop)

For any "get <X> running on Runpod" task, follow the **development loop** in
`runpod-usage/reference/development-loop.md`: decide pod vs serverless → provision → set up
(only if from-scratch) → verify → deliver → cost-guard + teardown. Two rules bind within it:

- **Prefer a prebuilt template / Hub worker over building an image from scratch.**
- **Before delivering, verify the workload with a real request from outside the pod/endpoint
  — a "Running"/"ready" status does not mean it is serving.**

It branches to two sub-loops:

- **Service you open at a URL** (Ollama, ComfyUI, dev box) →
  [`runpod-usage/reference/pod-workflows.md`](../runpod-usage/reference/pod-workflows.md)
  (ports + env + volume at creation, SSH-exec install, bind `0.0.0.0`, poll the
  proxy URL). Execute in the runpodctl lane.
- **Request/response API that scales to zero** (Whisper, inference) →
  [`runpod-usage/reference/endpoint-workflows.md`](../runpod-usage/reference/endpoint-workflows.md)
  (Hub worker vs flash vs custom image; invoke `/run`/`/runsync`; poll job status).

## Worked examples (golden paths)

This is **step 0 of routing**, not an appendix. Two dozen end-to-end scenarios
(nearly all **live-verified on a real account**) live in
[`./golden-paths/README.md`](./golden-paths/README.md), with the real commands and the
observed output to copy from — plus a Gotchas and a Cost & cleanup section each, which
is the part that is expensive to rediscover.

**Match the task to a row below and open that path before you plan or call anything.**
A partial match is still worth opening: the closest path's ordering and gotchas usually
transfer even when the model, GPU, or region does not. Only fall through to the lane
tables above when nothing here is close.

## Multi-lane tasks

Sequence is always **understand → produce artifacts → manage infra → verify**,
because infra can only reference artifacts that already exist. Keep each step in
one lane, and switch lanes at credential boundaries.

Example — "deploy `openai/gpt-oss-20b` to a serverless endpoint":
1. **runpod-usage** — serverless vs pod, GPU tier for 20B, bake vs mount vs cache.
2. **companion-clis** — `hf download …`, `docker build --platform=linux/amd64 …`, `docker push`.
3. **runpod-mcp** or **runpodctl** — create the endpoint referencing the image + GPU pool.
4. Same infra lane — invoke the endpoint / check status to verify.

## Auth

Everything is one key: **`RUNPOD_API_KEY`** (https://console.runpod.io/user/settings).
Each lane just makes that key resolvable — `runpodctl doctor`, `flash login`, MCP
stdio env var, or MCP hosted "Sign in with Runpod" (OAuth, no key on disk).
Companion CLIs use their **own** credentials (HuggingFace token, GitHub auth,
Docker Hub PAT, Runpod **S3** keys for `aws`) — do not reuse `RUNPOD_API_KEY` for
those.
