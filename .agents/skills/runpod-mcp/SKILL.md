  Manage Runpod infrastructure — pods, serverless endpoints, jobs, templates,
  network volumes, container-registry auth, GPU/CPU catalog, and billing — via
  the Runpod MCP server's structured tool calls. Use when the Runpod MCP tools
  (create-pod, list-endpoints, …) are connected in this session, or to connect
  them (hosted OAuth or local npx). Prefer this over runpodctl for plain infra
  CRUD when MCP is available; use runpodctl for the terminal, file transfer, or
  SSH setup.

# Runpod MCP

The Runpod MCP server exposes Runpod's control plane as structured tool calls,
so an MCP-capable agent can manage infrastructure without shelling out. It is the
same Runpod REST API that `runpodctl` uses — pick MCP when its tools are
connected (typed params, structured errors, no shell quoting).

**For a multi-step job, read the worked example before calling tools.** Tool calls are easy
to issue and easy to issue in the wrong order — the verified end-to-end sequences live in
[runpod/golden-paths/README.md](../runpod/golden-paths/README.md) (image → template →
endpoint, pod → volume → serverless, multi-region, autoscaling, monitoring). This skill
covers what each tool does; the paths cover what order to do them in and what it costs.

## Connect

Connect the hosted server with **your API key as a Bearer header** if you also use runpodctl/flash — that one key auths the MCP *and* the CLIs (the 80% path):

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http runpod -s user https://mcp.getrunpod.io/ \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $RUNPOD_API_KEY"
```

Plain **OAuth** ("Sign in with Runpod", via `npx @runpod/mcp-server@latest add`) is MCP-only — the CLIs stay unauthed, so use it only for MCP-only work. Local **stdio** runs the server as a subprocess with your key. Those variants + the key-vs-OAuth tradeoff: **[reference/connect.md](reference/connect.md)**. After connecting, reconnect the client (in Claude Code, `/mcp`) so the tools load.

**Verify it's live (do this before relying on MCP):** in Claude Code run `/mcp` —
`runpod` should show **Connected**, not *Needs authentication* (if it's the latter,
sign in there first; the bundled plugin server registers the URL but stays inert
until you authenticate). Confirm a real call works by asking for `list-endpoints`.
If the `runpod` tools aren't present at all, the server isn't connected — (re)run the
install above, or fall back to **runpodctl** for this task.

**Check the server version (which REST API it drives):** the MCP `initialize` handshake
returns it in `serverInfo.version`. `/mcp` in Claude Code shows it, or probe the hosted
server directly:

```bash
printf '%s\n' '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"probe","version":"0"}}}' \
| curl -s -X POST https://mcp.getrunpod.io/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" -H "Authorization: Bearer $RUNPOD_API_KEY" -d @-
# → serverInfo.version e.g. "3.0.0 [RUNPOD_REST_VERSION=v2]"  (verified 2026-07-29)
```

The MCP server drives Runpod's **REST v2** internally (`RUNPOD_REST_VERSION=v2`), so most
tools avoid the buggy **public `rest.runpod.io/v1`** control API. Two exceptions worth
knowing: the Hub, public-endpoint and `set-endpoint-gpus` tools go through GraphQL (so they
work under either REST version), and **CPU serverless endpoints are not creatable through
MCP** — v2 has no CPU-endpoint concept at all (`create-endpoint` requires `gpuPoolIds`), so
use `runpodctl serverless create --compute-type CPU` for those.

**Prefer MCP or `runpodctl` over hand-rolled `rest.runpod.io/v1` calls for creating endpoints.**

## Tool surface

Structured tools, grouped by resource:

- **Pods** — list, get, create, update, start, stop, restart, delete, stream logs.
- **Serverless endpoints** — list, get, create, update, delete; list workers; list releases; stream worker logs.
  - **Logs are no longer an MCP-only capability** — runpodctl grew `pod logs` and `serverless logs` in v2.10.0. MCP still returns already-parsed, bounded frames, which is the easier shape inside an agent; reach for the CLI when you are shell-only or want `--follow`. Job *output* streaming (`stream-job`) remains MCP-only.
  - `create-endpoint` takes `endpointType: QUEUE` (default) or `LOAD_BALANCER` — see golden path 14. The routing type is fixed at creation; `update-endpoint` cannot change it.
  - Read an endpoint's invoke URLs from `requestUrls` on the get/list reply instead of assembling them.
  - To pin a specific GPU **SKU** on an existing endpoint use `set-endpoint-gpus`; `create-endpoint`/`update-endpoint` expose only `gpuPoolIds` and can't express a SKU (`deploy-hub-repo` can pin one at deploy time via `gpuIds` exclusions).
- **Jobs (serverless runtime)** — run, runsync, status, stream, cancel, retry, health, purge queue.
- **Hub** — `list-hub-repos` (public catalog of prebuilt Serverless workers and Pod templates: vLLM, ComfyUI, …) and `deploy-hub-repo`, which deploys a repo's listed release as an endpoint — the same as clicking Deploy on the Hub.
- **Public endpoints** — `list-public-endpoints`: managed pay-per-use model APIs (text/image/video/audio) that need no deployment. Call the returned endpointId with `run-endpoint`/`runsync-endpoint`.
- **Templates** — list, get, create, update, delete.
- **Network volumes** — list, get, create, update, delete. `create-network-volume` takes `volumeType` (`STANDARD` | `HIGH_PERFORMANCE`) and a size of 10–4096 GB; omit `volumeType` to get the data center's default tier. The tier is **immutable after creation** — `update-network-volume` can't change it.
- **Container registry auth** — list, get, create, delete. A username + password for **any** registry; pass the resulting id as `containerRegistryAuthId` on create-pod/create-endpoint.
- **ECR delegations** (`list-`/`create-`/`delete-registry-delegation`) — **AWS ECR only**, v2 only, and stores no credentials: you register a repository ARN and Runpod gets scoped pull access instead. Prefer it over a stored username/password for ECR. The reply carries a `dockerRegistryUri` — that's the image URI to deploy with.
- **Catalog** — list/get GPU types, list/get CPU types, list/get data centers.
- **Billing** — scoped usage/cost breakdowns (`get-billing`).

> Delete tools (`delete-template`, `delete-pod`, …) can return `isError: true` with

## Use MCP vs runpodctl

- **Use runpod-mcp** when the tools are connected AND the task is infra CRUD or a
  serverless job call the server exposes. Cap large job/log output to a file.
- **Use runpodctl instead** for: **`send`/`receive`** file transfer, **SSH** key
  management, **`doctor`** setup, **model cache** — or any shell-only agent, or
  when the user wants a reproducible command.
- **Hand pod creation to runpodctl** for a **multi-GPU priority list** (MCP's v2
  create-pod takes one GPU type; extra `gpuTypeIds` are dropped with a `_warning`
  on success), or for a **template + CPU** pod together — `create-pod` rejects that
  combination, since a template deploy is GPU-and-v2-only. Each alone is fine in
  MCP: `templateId` (v2-only, `imageName` then optional, and each field you pass
  replaces the template's whole value rather than merging) or `computeType: "CPU"`.
- **Not this lane:** writing/deploying your own Python (→ flash); downloading
  models or building/pushing images (→ companion-clis).

For concepts (pods vs serverless, GPU selection, storage), read
