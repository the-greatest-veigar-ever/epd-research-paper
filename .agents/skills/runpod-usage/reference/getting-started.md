# Getting started (auth & first-run setup)

Before any lane can act, its credential has to resolve. Everything Runpod-side
uses **one key**, `RUNPOD_API_KEY`; the companion CLIs use their own. Do the setup
for the lane you're about to use, then follow the development loop.

## Get the tools

Install only the lane you need; full per-OS matrices + source links live in each
lane's `SKILL.md` (linked). You don't need all of them.

| Lane | Quick install | Source / docs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **runpodctl** (CLI) | `curl -sSL https://cli.runpod.net \| bash` (or `brew install runpod/runpodctl/runpodctl`) | [source](https://github.com/runpod/runpodctl) · [`runpodctl/SKILL.md`](../../runpodctl/SKILL.md) |
| **flash** (deploy your own code) | `uv tool install runpod-flash` (or `pip install runpod-flash`; Python 3.10–3.13) | [source](https://github.com/runpod/flash) · [`flash/SKILL.md`](../../flash/SKILL.md) |
| **runpod-mcp** (hosted) | `npx @runpod/mcp-server@latest add` (guided; OAuth) | [source](https://github.com/runpod/runpod-mcp) · [`runpod-mcp/SKILL.md`](../../runpod-mcp/SKILL.md) |
| **runpod-mcp** (local stdio) | `claude mcp add runpod -e RUNPOD_API_KEY=... -- npx -y @runpod/mcp-server` | same as above |
| **companion CLIs** (`hf`/`gh`/`docker`/`aws`) | per-tool; see the skill | [`companion-clis/SKILL.md`](../../companion-clis/SKILL.md) |

Nothing to install for the **hosted MCP** beyond configuring your client, and the
`runpod-usage` concepts need no install. After installing, set the key below.

**Want the Runpod tools in one go?** Copy-paste (drop any line you won't use):

```bash
npx skills add runpod/runpod-plugins-official # the skills — works with any agent
curl -sSL https://cli.runpod.net | bash       # runpodctl — infra CLI (or: brew install runpod/runpodctl/runpodctl)
uv tool install runpod-flash                  # flash — deploy your own code (or: pip install runpod-flash)
npx @runpod/mcp-server@latest add             # hosted MCP server — guided setup, OAuth
```

Companion CLIs (`docker`, `gh`, `hf`, `aws`) are separate and OS-specific — install only the
ones a task needs, per [`companion-clis/SKILL.md`](../../companion-clis/SKILL.md).

## The Runpod API key

Get it once at **https://console.runpod.io/user/settings** → API Keys. Then make
it resolvable for the lane. Resolution order (runpodctl, flash, and runpod-python
all use it): **`RUNPOD_API_KEY` env var → `.env` → `~/.runpod/config.toml`** (in that
file the key is the `apikey` field, TOML `apikey = '...'`). If you need the raw key
yourself (e.g. an `Authorization: Bearer` header for a direct API call), prefer
`$RUNPOD_API_KEY` and fall back to that field:
`KEY="${RUNPOD_API_KEY:-$(grep '^apikey' ~/.runpod/config.toml | sed "s/apikey = '//;s/'//")}"`.

| Lane | Set the key | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **runpodctl** | `export RUNPOD_API_KEY=...` | Non-interactive — runpodctl reads it. Best for agents/CI/scripts. |
| runpodctl (human) | `runpodctl doctor` | Interactive; stores the key **and** sets up SSH keys. Prompts, so not for agents. |
| **flash** | `export RUNPOD_API_KEY=...` | Or `flash login` — browser OAuth that **saves a real API key to `~/.runpod/config.toml`**, which runpodctl reads too, so one login serves both. Human-only (needs a browser). |
| **runpod-mcp (hosted)** | "Sign in with Runpod" OAuth on first connect | No key on disk. Or pass `Authorization: Bearer $RUNPOD_API_KEY`. |
| **runpod-mcp (local)** | `RUNPOD_API_KEY` env in the MCP client config | Forwarded to the API. |

**Rule (agents):** in automation, set the key with `export RUNPOD_API_KEY=...` (runpodctl and
flash both honor it — the closest thing to one-step setup); never run `runpodctl doctor`, which
prompts.

Context: the **hosted MCP is the exception** — it uses its own `/mcp` "Sign in with Runpod" OAuth
(or pass the same key as an `Authorization: Bearer` header). Authing the MCP does not set up the
CLIs, and the export does not authenticate the hosted MCP's OAuth.

## SSH (only needed for pods you exec into)

Pods created with `--ssh` (the runpodctl default) are reachable once you have a key
registered. **Register the key BEFORE creating the pod** — Runpod injects registered
keys at boot, so one added after the pod is running won't work until a restart.

- Check what's registered: `runpodctl ssh list-keys`.
- Register a key (do this first if none):
  - Human: `runpodctl doctor` — generates + registers a key and stores the API key.
  - Agent/scripted: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -N ''` then
    `runpodctl ssh add-key --key-file ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` (or `--key "ssh-ed25519 …"`).
- Get connection details for a specific pod: `runpodctl ssh info <pod-id>` (prints
  the ssh command + key path; does not connect).
- Agents connect non-interactively:
  `ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -p <port> root@<host> 'cmd'`.

Serverless endpoints need no SSH.

## Companion CLI credentials (separate from RUNPOD_API_KEY)

Do NOT reuse the Runpod key for these — each has its own (see the `companion-clis`
skill for details):

- **`hf`** — HuggingFace token (`hf auth login`); read scope to pull, write to push.
- **`docker`** — Docker Hub PAT (`docker login`).
- **`gh`** — GitHub auth (`gh auth login`).
- **`aws`** — Runpod **S3** keys (user id `user_…` + S3 API key `rps_…`), with
  `--region <dc> --endpoint-url https://s3api-<dc>.runpod.io/`. NOT AWS creds, NOT
  the Runpod API key.

## Verify you're set up

```bash
export RUNPOD_API_KEY=...
runpodctl user            # prints your account (confirms the key works)
runpodctl gpu list        # confirms API access
```

Then pick your workload and follow `development-loop.md`.
